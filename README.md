[gdnsd](http://gdnsd.org/) is a powerful Authoritative-only DNS server with
some advanced features such as geographic (or other sorts of) balancing,
redirection, wighting and service-state-conscious failover at the DNS layer.

The `ganto.gdnsd` Ansible role installs and configures the name service and
is able to generate zone files from name records defined in the Ansible
inventory and properly increase the serial on zone updates.


### Installation

This role requires at least Ansible `v1.9.0`. To install it run:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/ganto/ansible-gdnsd ganto.gdnsd
```


### Documentation

Currently the documentation is only available in raw format in the
[docs](/docs/) directory.
